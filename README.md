I used the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository.  The data consists of 5 columns:  variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous) entropy of image (continuous) class (integer) Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.
